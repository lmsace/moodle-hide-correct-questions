2. Navigate to the course where the quiz is located.
3. Turn editing on.
4. Click on the quiz activity to access its settings.
5. In the quiz settings page, locate the '**Question behavior**' section and '*click on*' it.
6. Look for the '**Each attempt builds on the last**' setting and '**enable**' it. This setting allows each attempt to build on the previous one, retaining the user's previous responses and providing a cumulative learning experience.

7. Next, scroll down to the '**Extra restrictions on attempts**' section.
8. From the dropdown setting '**Hide questions on attempt**', select the option that says '**Hide the correct answered question in new attempt**'.
9. To keep the question mark and feedback from your previous attempt on a hidden question, select the "**Auto grade the correct questions**" option in the "**Questions auto-grade**" dropdown setting.

10. Save the quiz settings to apply the changes.
With these settings enabled, when a learner attempts the quiz again, the questions will be hidden, allowing them to reflect on their previous attempt and make improvements without directly seeing the correct answers.

>Note: It's important to communicate these settings to your learners so they understand the behavior of the quiz and the purpose behind hiding the questions on subsequent attempts.
